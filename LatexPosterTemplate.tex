% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.

\section{Introduction}
The current rating system for applications is antiquated. As more people adopt smartphones as their choice of mobile technology, it becomes increasingly
difficult for users to sift through reviews in order to determine how other users feel about a mobile application. In addition, the 5-star rating systems used in many modern markets are too coarse to describe accurate sentiment. Our goal is to develop a system that uses existing mobile application data in order to provide users with a better understanding of the reception of an app. 

\section{Background and Related Work}

In order to perform sentiment analysis, two approaches were taken: using SentiWordNet scores and SVM machine learning based on ratings.

SVM use in sentiment analysis has proven to be more effective than other forms of machine learning [citation needed].  When preprocessing input for an SVM, it is helpful to use WordNet lemmas.  WordNet is a lexical resource that groups English words into synonym sets, and words are tagged by part of speech.  To normalize the input, term frequency--inverse document frequency (tf-idf) can be used.  To reduce dimensionality, latent semantic analysis (LSA), which uses singular value decomposistion, can be used.

SentiWordNet is a dataset that assigns a sentiment score to members of WordNet.  Sentiment scores were generated using the structure of WordNet as well as the Princeton WordNet Gloss Corpus.

%Describe specialized and relevant related background necessary to appreciate the work.  Include references to the literature where appropriate, and briefly explain where your work departs from that done by others.  Reference lists do not count towards the limit on the length of the abstract.
%This is an example of a citation~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

\section{Approach and Uniqueness}
%Describe your approach in attacking the problem and how your approach is novel.  Your hypothesis may be here.

\subsection{Sentiment Analysis}
One implemented sentiment analysis approach involved using SentiWordNet.  Part of speech tagging was performed on each review. The sum of SentiWordNet scores for adverbs, verbs, and adjectives was taken to determine whether the review was positive, negative, or neutral overall.  Each review was assigned a sentiment score of 1, -1, or 0 (positive, negative, or neutral), and each app received a sentiment score which was calculated by the proportion of positive to negative reviews.

Results were compared to another approach to sentiment analysis: using a support vector machine (SVM) trained using the ratings of a subset of the comments.  To transform the reviews into SVM input, the adjectives, adverbs, and verbs were considered (these were determined using part of speech tagging).  These words were lemmatized using WordNet, the comments were normalized via tf-idf, and to reduce the dimensionality of input, LSA was used.  A sample of one-star and five-star comments was taken from the corpus of reviews to train the SVM.

The advantage of the SVM approach is that it potentially handles domain-specific factors better, but it is also potentially non-extensible to applications outside of the training set.  However, in this project, comments for the training set were taken from all applications, and the purpose of performing semantic analysis was primarily to classify the sentiments of the more neutrally-rate comments (2-4 stars).

\section{Results and Application}
There are many potential applications for this calculated sentiment score. One particularly interesting applicaton is developer rating: using the aggregate sentiment scores of the applications created by a developer, we can generate a generalized ``reputation'' score that will attempt to measure the reliability of the developer.

 This reputation score will provide much needed information about developer reliability which can be a dramatic improvement over the existing information. To elaborate, the Google Play store designates certain developers as ``Top Developers'' which is indicated via badges. However, being a ``Top Developer'' does not indicate that the developer has written a large number of apps or even that the apps are of good quality.
